Introduction\nIn this experiment, the main problem is the diameter of the balls can’t be\nmeasured directly due to their circular surface and the limited tools including\nrulers and A4 paper. To solve this problem, some methods supposed to have\nhigher accuracy to indirectly measure the diameter of balls with three different\nsizes are needed. It’s essential to understand precision and accuracy.\nPrecision mainly focuses on the centralization of data while accuracy\nconcentrates on whether data are close to the true value or not. In general,\ndata that are inaccurate but precise are random errors, and data that are\naccurate but imprecise are systematic errors. Besides, measurement error\nwhich usually appears in measuring is unavoidable. All three errors appeared\nin the experiment.\nⅡ. Method\nMethod 1.1:\nMark the basketball’s center and one cut point on the paper and make parallel\nlines for them like in Fig 1.\nMethod 1.2:\nDraw two parallel lines through two marked points like in Fig 2.\nMethod 2.1:\nTear a circle by hand on the A4 paper that a tennis ball could fit right through.\nMethod 2.2:\nWrap and roll the A4 paper around the tennis ball and mark the intersection\nposition of the A4 paper.\nMethod 3.1:\nClamp the glass bead with two parallel plastic rulers and mark the plastic rulers’\nposition on the A4 paper.\nMethod 3.2:\nWrap the strip from A4 paper around the glass bead and mark the intersection\nposition.\nOverall, both methods of basketball are finding the cut point and measuring it\ndirectly. Because the basketball size is relatively large, it is hard to use the\n“wrap” or “hole” methods and they can increase errors. Method 2.1 is less\nmanual which could reduce random errors. Moreover, the ruler is relatively\nlonger for the tennis ball while using the direct method and method 2.2 can\nmake the A4 paper wrap around the tennis ball to measure precisely. Method\n3.1 and 3.2 could fix its position, which overcomes the problems of the glass\nbead’s smooth surface and smaller size than other methods.\nⅢ. Result\n1. Method 1.1, n = 3, SD[1] = 4.5826mm, 259.0 ± 4.5826mm\n2. Method 1.2, n = 3, SD = 3.2787mm, 234.5 ± 3.2787mm\nMethod 1.1 is to measure the radius and twice the result is the diameter.\nMethod 1.2 is to measure the diameter directly. The mean values of the two\nmethods are shown in Figure 1. Method 1.1 has been measured three times,\nwith an average value of 259mm, and method 1.2 has been measured three\ntimes, with an average value of 234.5mm.\n1. Method 2.1, n = 3, SD = 0.4mm, 66.2 ± 0.4mm\n2. Method 2.2, n = 3, SD = 1.0786mm, 65.0 ± 1.0786mm\nMethod 2.1 can directly measure the diameter of the hole in the paper. Method\n2.2 needs to use the formula d = C/π to get the diameter. The mean values of\nthe two methods are shown in the figure 2. Method 2.1 and method 2.2 both\nwere measured three times with mean values of 66.2mm and 65mm.\n1. Method 3.1, n = 3, 1 SD = 0.4359mm, 14.5 ± 0.4359mm\n2. Method 3.2, n = 3, 1 SD = 0.2646mm, 15.5 ± 0.2646mm\nMethod 3.1 can directly measure the diameter of the hole in the paper. Method\n3.2 also uses d = C/π to calculate the diameter. The mean values of the two\nmethods are shown in the figure 3. Method 1 has been measured 3 times, with\nan average value of 14.5mm. method 2 has been measured 3 times, with an\naverage value of 15.5mm.\nⅣ. Discussion\nBased on the measured values, the true values and the CV (CV=SD/�\u0000 )[2], the\naccuracy and precision can be reflected in Table 1.\nMethod 1.1 is only suit for measuring the diameter of a larger ball due to the\nsize of the ball and convenience of the measurement. It can increase the\nmeasurement error if it is used to measure the size of other balls. Method 1.2\nand method 3.1 can be grouped, they all need to fix the ball. The balls with\nsmooth surfaces can’t be used because they are not easy to fix which can lead\nto larger random errors and measurement errors. Method 2.1 can only be used\nto measure the diameter of a medium-sized ball. If the ball is so large that it\nexceeds the size of paper, then it can’t be measured. If the ball has a small\nsize, it will increase the difficulty of digging the hole and the measurement error.\nMethod 2.2 and method 3.2 are the same kind of measurement. Except for the\nballs larger than the size of the paper, all other balls can be measured by this\nindirect method. Besides, the thickness of the ruler was not ignored in some\nmethods, the results will be inaccurate. In this case, the system error can be\nreduced by subtracting the thickness of the ruler. Additionally, balls with the\nrougher surface are difficult to roll, allowing for a more accurate measurement\nof diameter.\nMoreover, the measurement values of the same object will be different with the\ninfluence of the measurements’ number, operation, and other external\nenvironmental factors.\nAccording to Table 1, the measured values of method 1.2 of basketball have\nsystematic errors. And Figures 7-9 show that methods 1.2, 2.1, 3.2 meet the\nspecifications for the diameter of three different sizes of balls.\nⅤ. Reflection\nDuring the measurement process, group members came up with simple and\naccurate methods with enthusiasm and creativity. Each member had a clear\ntask and completed it with high quality, which greatly improved the efficiency.\nEnsuring the accuracy and precision of experiments requires careful\nexperimental design, standardized experimental operations, error control and\ncorrection, correct result analysis, and unified management of time and\nenvironment.\nIf the task was done once again, the first four steps should be done before\nexperimenting in class and there needs more interaction between members for\nbetter cooperation.\nReference:\n[1]Heiny, K.
